Hi, I'm Dominick! I spent a long time doing mathematics and teaching, and recently entered the world of software engineering. The purpose of this website is to organize and document my work in a single location.

Within CS, I've been exploring operating systems (and to a lesser extent, design of programming languages). Within mathematics, I'm interested in geometric and algebraic topology.
